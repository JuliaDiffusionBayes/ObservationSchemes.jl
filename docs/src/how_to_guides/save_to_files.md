# How to save decorated data to a file?
***

A convenient way to save decorate data to a file is to use the package [JuliaDB.jl](https://juliadata.github.io/JuliaDB.jl/stable/).

Once you've decorated your data, simply create a `JuliaDB` table:
```julia
dec_data = ...

using JuliaDB

t = table(1:length(dec_data), dec_data, pkey=1)
```
and save it to the disk
```julia
save(t, "path/to/destination/filename.db")
```

Your file will contain decorated data i.e. complete information about the underlying process and how the data was collected together with the data themselves will be in that fileâ€“no need for having to specify anything else externally.

You can then load the data back in with
```julia
t = load("path/to/destination/filename.db")
```
